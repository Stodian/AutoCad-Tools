# AutoCAD Tools for MEP Design

This repository contains a collection of custom AutoCAD tools developed to streamline and enhance the workflow of MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) design. These tools are designed to automate repetitive tasks, optimize design processes, and improve the overall efficiency of drawing and managing MEP layouts in AutoCAD.

## Features

- **Text Cleanup Tool**: Automatically removes all unnecessary text from CAD layouts, leaving only room names and areas.
- **Layer Management Tool**: Simplifies the process of managing layers, allowing for quick modifications and standardization across drawings.
- Additional tools targeting specific aspects of the MEP design process in AutoCAD.
